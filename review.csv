I am disappointed in the new fabric and sizes of the burnout version. Way too small and fabric pills.","As I stated in the previous question, I love the 100% cotton merchantile jacket, regular and 3/4 sleeve. I have purchased 30-40 of them. I was extremely disappointed in the newer version that is a synthetic blend. It looks pretty but the sizes were way off and the fabric “pills” almost immediately after wearing. The availability has been spotty to nonexistent for the 100% cotton for several years. I’ve purchased these from XCVI directly, and from Target(wearables). The 100% cotton is amazing! 
The blend that I purchased from QVC did not fit, and the fabric was inferior. I also had issues with returning the item. So now I’m stuck with one that doesn’t fit.

I wish you had more of the 100% cotton ones available. I did purchase quite a few in the oakmoss, 6 i think and just recently in black 3 and oil washed graphite 2. that they came in the newer colors. They only had one medium black 3/4 available and no Large black 3/4 ones when I received an email saying they were back in stock. I love your 100% cotton French terry and have a few other styles, one that buttoned down the front and had a longer back, kind of like a riding jacket ran very small. The xlarge  didn’t even fit. I am consistently a medium in the 100% cotton French terry.","Leggings 100% cotton, and organic cotton items. Ok if they have a very low percent spandex.

The website when I use my phone is glitchy. If I click on an item for a closer look it sends me back to the beginning! And almost too much on there ( of course I hate to say that because I love choices but it gets overwhelming!) And last, the prices are a bit high on some things. I try to hit the sales. Maybe for full price orders lower the limit for free shipping so say I can afford one $79 item to add to my wardrobe and get free shipping then done and ordered! But if I have to reach the $96 free shipping limit( I think that is the free shipping threshold?) then I have to add a second item and likely not to do that if it was just a shirt or top I was eyeing up and wanted to order on its own. On the positive your clothes are super comfortable, great quality and unique colors- unlike any other company I purchase clothing from!

It really made me question where the fabric is coming from and how much of it is faulty.
At full price the garments seem very overpriced. On the other hand, there have been some great sales. My favorite was the $20-$30-$40 sale or something like that. 
I really despise the shipping fee. I would make many more purchases if the shipping fee would just go away. Or charge me $29 for a year of free shipping. 
I am frustrated that the loyalty coupons are only usable on full price merchandise. Please let me choose what I want to use it for. Again, this will make me more likely to place frequent orders.","Shoes! I often want to purchase the shoes shown with the outfits and I have to contact you to ask what brand they are or I use Google image search.

The other pants styles you carry are either not flattering (I will not be wearing actual crop styles anytime soon because they hit me just below the knee) or they are so long as to be ridiculous. I have no interest in buying causal clothing that I have to have altered either. And the problem with a lot of your tops is that they are often billowy, flowy, lots of fabric, too long, etc. They are not suitable for someone my size -- they are overwhelming. And I'm not a size 0 either -- I can fluctuate anywhere between a size 8P, 10P, 12P or even a 14P. But it doesn't matter which size I might be at a given time in my life, I cannot handle a large volume of fabric that engulfs my frame. While I do enjoy wearing the few pants styles I find flattering, I seldom find any other styles in your store that are flattering. Also - please note that clingy/jersey fabrics are not flattering on many ""mature"" bodies. Such fabrics for tops enhance every figure flaw imaginable.","In general, you do not have styles that flatter short women -- especially if they are on the ""mature"" side. You either carry styles that look great on very slim bodies or on very tall bodies. But if an older woman is short (say 5'1"") - forget it.

g8iok2qkma9f3itxg8iok2bkswwt9ygb,marilyn.thompson@outlook.com,At a boutique,,,Several years,,6,8,8,Designs are unique and stylish,,"Sizing is inconsistent. Often different colours of the same clothing item are quite a bit larger or smaller. 

The colours of clothing on the website are also very inconsistent. It’s hard to tell what colour a piece of clothing will actually be when photos of different items in that colour are completely different. For example, pants and leggings in Sumac Pigment look burgundy in some photos and rust or even burnt orange in others.

Sometimes the descriptions of items are highly inaccurate. For example, I recently bought a pair of Grassroots Cord Leggings. I have two pairs of Grassroots leggings in the regular cotton fabric and they fit perfectly -  snug and fitted like you would expect from a legging.  The cord version were a completely different fit: huge in the waste and a full four inches bigger around in the legs, calves and ankles. The were like a baggy pant instead of a legging. When I called customer service, assuming that the leggings were labelled as a small but were actually a large, I was told that that is the way the cord version are sized, and that the baggy cord pant I received is intended to be that way. 

If this is the case, why would you call the cord version a legging? Why not call it the Grassroots cord pant?

I live in Canada and pay a lot in shipping fees and duty and exchange rates (as our dollar is worth about 30% less than the US dollar). It would be too expensive to ship things back when I need to return something, so having consistent sizing, accurate descriptions, and being able to know what a colour really looks like is important. 

I have purchased a lot of XCVi clothing in the past few years, but I’m not sure I will continue after the cord leggings and a few other tops I’ve purchased that turned out to be a completely different colour or size than expected.",Stretch denim leggings or jeans,,0,,0,,0,,0,I don't use social media,1,,,,0,FM Radio,1,,0,,0,,0,,0,,0,,,Masters / Graduate Degree,6,,55 - 64,5,No thanks,0,2/12/2021 14:40,2/12/2021 15:09,ac64f221d4
